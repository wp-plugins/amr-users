== Description ==
Configurable users listings by meta keys and values, comment count and post count. Includes display, inclusion, exclusion, sorting configuration and an option to export to CSV. 

The admin settings area is aimed at an administrator, who will design and setup the reports for less skilled editors or website managers.  Some lists are provided pre-configured to get you going - you can add more or change these.

The first field of each listing will offer a link to edit that user.
The fields you see listed will vary depending on the plugins that you have in use, and on the meta data that the plugins may have created.  In the Screenshots you will some data from subscribe 2, register plus and your members plugins.

If you have very large numbers of users, the post count and particularly the comment count (no wordpress cacheing) listings may be slow.  If very slow, please contact me and we can consider ways to cache the data.  If you wanted to list this data on the front end, the performance would have to be improved.  for now it is assumed to be admin/editor use only.

If anyone would like to offer some translations for other languages, please do.  The Code Styling Localisation Plugin is very useful for this.

= More to come =
Please add a comment to the site about any features you would like to see - a contribution towards that would also help! Planned features:
*   add more confiruration for sorting and selection, including in the user area.
*   add statistic reports with groupings and totals
*   make skill level of user list access configurable
*   possibly allow lists to be specified as shortcode lists - need to figure out how to control this.  IE administrator says which data / lists may be made public, or displayed in private membership sections.
*   maybe shortcodes to provide public or member only listings.
